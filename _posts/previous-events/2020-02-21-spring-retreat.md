The Divine Stream

Spring retreat was such a refreshing time! It was so good to get away from school and just enjoy God. The topic for the retreat was “The Divine Stream”. We learned that God has been flowing from eternity past to eternity future, and is flowing to reach us! John 4:4 says “But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.” It was also wonderful to see that the divine stream supplies man and satisfies God. Oh also, the weather couldn’t have been better, and we had a ton of fun walking by the lake and playing frisbee. Getting more sleep was also a huge plus. But best of all was spending time and enjoying Christ with fellow believers all over the Northeast. - S.F.
